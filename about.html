        <p class="aboutPara">Our solution is a platform that connects local workers with individuals or businesses that require their services. This platform would serve as a marketplace where people can find reliable and skilled workers for various tasks such as plumbing, electrical work, welding, carpentry, and more. In this we allow local shops who are familiar with skilled workers in the area to add their information to the platform.</p>

        <p class="aboutPara">However, before any worker is added to the platform, they should meet certain criteria, such as having the necessary certifications, insurance or background check. The goal is to provide a reliable and efficient way to find skilled workers while providing a steady stream of work for local workers.</p>
